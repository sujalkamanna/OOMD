# **Object-Oriented Modeling and Design (OOMD)**

This project demonstrates various object-oriented modeling techniques and their application in system design. The following diagrams are included to represent key aspects of the system’s structure, behavior, and runtime architecture.

## **Diagrams Included:**

1. **State Model Diagram**  
   This diagram represents the different states of the system (e.g., for a telephone line, capturing various states such as idle, dialing, and connected). It shows how the system transitions between states based on activities and events.

2. **Class Diagram**  
   A basic class diagram identifying key classes, their attributes, and relationships. This diagram describes the system's static structure, highlighting essential components like classes, objects, and their associations.

3. **Use Case Diagram**  
   This diagram captures the system's functional requirements, illustrating interactions between the system and external actors (e.g., customer, service provider). It defines the key use cases, such as placing a call or making a payment.

4. **Use Case Diagram (with Templates and Steps)**  
   A more detailed version of the Use Case Diagram, including templates for each use case and a description of the steps involved in different scenarios. This helps in understanding how each use case is executed from start to finish.

5. **Activity Diagram**  
   This diagram illustrates the flow of control or data through the system. It models business workflows or processes, representing actions, decisions, and concurrent activities, such as the sequence of operations in processing a call or transaction.

6. **Component Diagram**  
   A component diagram showing how the system is structured using both existing and new components. This diagram represents the system’s components and their dependencies, which are essential for modular development and reuse.

7. **Deployment Diagram**  
   A deployment diagram that models the physical runtime architecture of the system. It shows how software components are distributed across hardware nodes, illustrating the interaction between the system's software and hardware infrastructure.
